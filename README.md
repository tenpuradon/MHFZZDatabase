This app is derived from GH Studios apps.
You can find source code here:
https://github.com/gatheringhallstudios/MHGenDatabase

All credit for initial code goes to them.

The database is designed to be used with the Community Edition of the game. It may stay a little out of date due to how fast the game evolves.
