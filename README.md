This app is derived from GH Studios apps.
You can find source code here:

All credit for initial code goes to them.

The database is designed to be used with the Community Edition of the game. It may stay a little out of date due to how fast the game evolves.

I want to thank everyone who helped me so far.
Especially:
- silversoulart for app banner and icon design (and work put in future high definition remake of map/monster images and creating missing item icons)
- supream and Sera for their time put into data gathering
